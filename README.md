# Queue
Hello friend, here is my simple implementation of the Queue data structure. 
The queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which 
the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 
My implementation contains methods which Queue has to contain in default, 
that are:
<ul>
<li><b>Enqueue</b> - adds new element into a queue;</li>
<li><b>Dequeue</b> - returns and delete first element in the queue;</li>
<li><b>Peek</b>    - just returns the first element in queue without deleting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The repostitory has two folders: <a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Queue/tree/master/QueryArray">QueryArray</a> - which contains implementation based on the array
and <a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Queue/tree/master/QueueList">QueueList</a> - which implementation based on List.</p>
