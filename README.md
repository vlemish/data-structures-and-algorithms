# Queue
Hello friend, here is my simple implementation of Queue data structure.
Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
My implementation contains methods which Queue has to contain in default, that are:
<ul>
<li><b>Enqueue</b> - adds new element into a queue</li>
<li><b>Dequeue</b> - returns and delete first element in queue</li>
<li><b>Peek</b>    - just returns first element in queue without deleting</li>
</ul>
<p>The repostitory has two folders:<a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Queue/tree/master/QueryArray">QueryArray which contains implementation based on array</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Queue/tree/master/QueueList">QueueList</a> which implementation based on List.</p>
