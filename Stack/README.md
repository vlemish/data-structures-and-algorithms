# Stack
Hello friend, here is my simple implementation of the Stack data structure. Stack is a linear data structure that follows a 
particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
My implementation contains methods which Stack has to contain in default, 
that are:
<ul>
<li><b>Push</b> - adds a new element in Stack;</li>
<li><b>Peek</b> - returns the Head element of the Stack;</li>
<li><b>Pop</b> - returns and deletes the Head element of the Stack.</li>
<li><b>Clear</b> - deletes all the elements from the Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also method <b>Print</b> which allows printing the Stack on the console.</p>
<p>The repository has two folders: <a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Stack/tree/master/StackOnArray">StackOnArray</a> - which contains implementation based on the array
and <a href="https://github.com/vlemish/Stack/tree/master/StackOnList">StackOnList</a> - which implementation based on List.</p>
